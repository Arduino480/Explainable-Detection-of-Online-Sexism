# Explainable-Detection-of-Online-Sexism

#Project Overview

This project aims to detect online sexism in text data from Reddit and Gab using various machine learning algorithms. We explore the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and BERT in identifying sexist content.

#Dataset 
We utilized datasets from Reddit and Gab, pre-processing the data to ensure quality and consistency.

#Algorithms and Results
We implemented four different algorithms:
   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   Naive Bayes
   Random Forest
   BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Among these, BERT delivered the highest F1 score, achieving an impressive 0.92.
