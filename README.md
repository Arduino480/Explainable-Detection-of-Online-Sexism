# Explainable-Detection-of-Online-Sexism
In our project, we developed an Explainable Online Sexism Detection system using Reddit and Gab datasets. Employing SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and BERT, we pre-processed the data and achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.92, with BERT outperforming all other algorithms.
